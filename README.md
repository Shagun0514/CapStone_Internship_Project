# Bluestock Mutual Fund Analytics Platform

Capstone internship project — an end-to-end analytics platform covering 40 mutual fund schemes: ETL, a SQLite database, exploratory analysis, performance metrics, an interactive Power BI dashboard, and advanced risk analytics with a simple fund recommender.

## Data Sources

- **fund_master** — 40 schemes: AMC, category, expense ratio, exit load, risk category
- **nav_history** — daily NAV records per scheme
- **scheme_performance** — trailing returns, alpha, beta, Sharpe, Sortino, risk grade
- **investor_transactions** — SIP / lumpsum / redemption transactions with demographics
- **portfolio_holdings** — stock-level sector weights per scheme
- **benchmark_indices** — NIFTY 50 and related index closes

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the ETL pipeline
```bash
python scripts/etl_pipeline.py
```
This loads raw CSVs from `data/raw/`, cleans and validates them, forward-fills NAV gaps on weekends/holidays, and writes cleaned output to `data/processed/`.

### 3. Build the database
The cleaned data is loaded into `data/db/bluestock_mf.db` following `sql/schema.sql`. Sample analytical queries are in `sql/queries.sql`.

### 4. Explore the notebooks
Run in order for the full analysis:
1. `01_data_ingestion.ipynb` — raw data loading and validation
2. `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` — cleaning, merging, DB load
3. `03_eda_analysis.ipynb` — 15-chart exploratory analysis
4. `04_performance_analytics.ipynb` — Sharpe, Beta, Alpha, drawdown
5. `05_advanced_analytics.ipynb` — VaR/CVaR, rolling Sharpe, cohorts, SIP continuity, recommender, sector HHI

### 5. Open the dashboard
Open `dashboard/bluestock_mf.pbix` in Power BI Desktop. Four pages: Industry Overview, Fund Performance (with NAV drill-through), Investor Analytics, SIP Trends.

### 6. Run the recommender
```bash
python scripts/recommender.py Moderate
```
Accepts `Low`, `Moderate`, or `High` as a risk appetite argument; returns the top 3 funds by Sharpe ratio in that risk band.

## Key Findings

- Small-cap funds carry the highest tail risk (VaR/CVaR); liquid funds the lowest — risk grades are empirically well-calibrated to realized volatility.
- ~98% of investors with 6+ SIP transactions show payment gaps beyond the 35-day continuity threshold, flagging a strong retention opportunity.
- Investor cohorts differ meaningfully in behavior: the 2024 cohort invests more per SIP and prefers equity; the 2025 cohort skews toward safer liquid funds.
- Several nominally "diversified" equity funds carry high sector concentration (HHI) — a hidden risk not visible from category labels alone.

## Notes on Methodology

- All annualization uses 252 trading days, not calendar days, to avoid overstating CAGR.
- NAV gaps on weekends/holidays are forward-filled after reindexing to the full trading calendar.
- The `.db` file is excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`); rebuild it locally via the ETL pipeline, or share `sql/schema.sql` to recreate the structure.
- AUM figures are labeled with explicit units (crore) in column names to avoid lakh/crore ambiguity.
